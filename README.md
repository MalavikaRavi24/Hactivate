### Project Description
An AI that deliberately tries to keep a conversation dull by replying with the most boring and irrelevent facts,It makes any any conversationawkward and slow.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Limited Engagement Due to Predictable Responses.Since the bot gives only indifferent or dismissive responses, users might quickly lose interest, as there is minimal variation in tone or content.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Add more personality traits, such as occasional moments of enthusiasm or sarcasm.
Create a more dynamic personality that might occasionally "cheer up" or "get bored" in reaction to different kinds of user input.
Track the conversation context so that the bot can show varying degrees of interest based on topics or user engagement levels.
